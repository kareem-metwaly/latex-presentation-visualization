# latex-presentation-visulaization
This is a simple latex template I used in my Ph.D. dissertation. Feel free to use/edit it if you want to.

I used the original template found [here](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/bredelebeamer-beamer-class/khpmhsshvyrq) 
but made some changes to fit my work.
Most of the changes are related to colors, adding the circle counter on the right top corner, and adding new helpful environments.

Sorry if my changes are not well documented.
The main file is [main.tex](main.tex). You can start from there and do whatever you want.

I only kept some slides related to the visualization as I think it might be useful for some people.

You will need to compile the project several times to get the correct output (at least 3 times)

I used some other tools to do some animations such as Adobe Animate, Illustrator and Photoshop.

To have animations working correctly, you need to use Adobe Reader. Other readers may not run animations.

## content

1. [main.tex](main.tex) contains an example of a tex presentation having the template and some animations.
2. [figs](figs/) has all figures used in the main.tex and template file.
3. [bredelebeamerKareem.cls](bredelebeamerKareem.cls) is the latex class template used.
4. [UserDefinedCommands.tex](UserDefinedCommands.tex) has some usefull commands that you may want to add (some are used by main.tex).
